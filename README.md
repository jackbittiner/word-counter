# Word Counter

This application takes the text of The Railway Children and counts the words. Simples!

## The Problem

The test is as follows:

1. Write an application that outputs the individual words that appear in the book, and how many times that word appears in the text file.
2.The second part is to also output whether the number of times each word appears is a prime number.

The following assumptions can be made:

Ignore punctuation and capitalisation
TDD is expected
